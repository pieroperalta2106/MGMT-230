# Company BackGround
Cloud9 Collective is an independent streetwear brand founded in 2025 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Born from the city’s skate, music, and creative scenes, it fills the gap for authentic, high-quality Canadian streetwear that’s premium yet accessible. Designed in-house and produced in limited batches with ethical partners, Cloud9 Collective celebrates comfort, confidence, and individuality for Gen Z and young adults who want style with soul.

# Cloud9 Collective will offer:

Hoodies & Crewnecks – premium cotton blends, relaxed fit
Graphic Tees – modern minimalist designs and seasonal prints
Cargo & Utility Pants – functional streetwear staples
Caps & Accessories – embroidered logos and limited drops
Seasonal Collections – small-batch releases

Future service expansion may include custom printing, collaborations, and wholesale partnerships.

# Target market or customers
Cloud9 Collective’s primary target market is Gen Z and young adults aged 16–30, with the core sweet spot being 18–25. These customers live in urban and suburban areas across Canada (especially BC, Ontario, and Alberta) and are active on Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest. They follow streetwear trends, sneaker culture, music scenes (hip-hop, indie, lo-fi, K-pop), and value outfits that photograph well and express their personal identity.
They are willing to spend $60–$140 CAD on hoodies, tees, and pants from independent brands they believe in, choosing quality and exclusivity over fast fashion. This group includes students, young creatives and professionals, hype enthusiasts who chase limited drops, and conscious shoppers who appreciate Canadian design, ethical production, and supporting smaller labels with authentic stories.
